/**
 * AckLevel is used in Asynchronous write messages to determine how to react to
 * writes.  This is useful when interacting with a connection from an actor and
 * needing to handle backpressure when writing large amounts of data.
 *
 * If AckFailure is selected, WriteStatus's of "Partial" (data partially
 * written but buffered, next write will fail), "Zero" (no data was written,
 * buffer full), and "Failed" (error, probably disconnected) will generate
 * WriteAck messages.
 *
 * If AckSuccess is selected, "Partial" and "Success" (data fully written) will
 * generate WriteAck
 *
 * The simplest approach is to AckAll and only send ByteStrings one at a time,
 * waiting for the WriteAck message each time.  The highest-throughput approach
 * is  to use AckFailure, and send messages as fast as possible, but be aware that
 * you will be entirely responsible for resending failed messages.
 *
 * WriteAck Messages are only sent to the ConnectionHandler's watcher (if one
 * exists, see the WatchedHandler trait), which may NOT necessarily be the
 * sender of the message.
 *
 * If you receive a Partial status, you should not send any more data until receiving a ReadyForData message
