/**
  * A Pipe is an abstraction that mediates interactions between producers and
  * consumers of a stream of data.  It can be thought of as a mutable buffer that
  * has built-in features for addressing both back-pressure (when the pipe
  * "fills") and forward-pressure (when the pipe "empties").  Items are "pushed"
  * into the pipe and "pulled" out of it.
  *
  * A Pipe is the combination of the [[Source]] and [[Sink]] traits, representing
  * the producer and consumer interfaces, respectively.  It should be noted that
  * a Pipe does not contain additional state beyond that provided by the Source
  * and Sink interfaces.  In other words, it may be possible for the producer
  * `Sink` side of a pipe to be Closed or Terminated, while the consumer `Source`
  * side is in a different state.
  *
  * The canonical implementation is the [[BufferedPipe]], backed by a
  * fixed-length buffer.  However pipes have many monadic and combinatorial
  * capabilities, allowing them to be mapped, linked together, flattened, and
  * multiplexed.
  *
  * As opposed to other libraries/frameworks that have a concept of streams,
  * sources, and sinks, these pipes are intended for low-level stream management.
  * They support several features that allow interation with pipes to be very
  * fast and efficient.  They form the backbone of all connection handlers and as
  * well as streaming protocols like http/2.  Pipes are *not* thread-safe.

  * fired.
  *
  * The most efficient way to use a `BufferedPipe` is with the `pullWhile`
  * method.  This allows the pipe to completely bypass buffering and items pushed
  * to the pipe are fast-tracked directly into the provided processing function.
