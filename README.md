Colossus takes part in the TechEmpower web framework benchmarks under the [JSON serialization](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#test=json) and [Plaintext](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#test=plaintext) tests.

Here's an overview of what you can find in this repo

* `colossus` : The framework
* `colossus-metrics` : high-performance metrics library (does not depend on colossus)
* `colossus-examples` : A few simple examples that can be run
* `colossus-testkit` : Small library containing a few useful tools for testing
* `colossus-tests` : The unit and integration tests for colossus
* `colossus-docs` : Markdown documentation

### Benchmarking

1. Start the main app in examples project:

    ```sbtshell
    sbt colossus-examples/run
    ```
    
2. Run `wrk` with 50 connections, across 2 threads, a pipeline size of 16, for 10 seconds:

    ```bash
    wrk -c 50 -t 2 -d 10 --latency -s pipeline.lua http://localhost:9007/plaintext -- 16
    ```

**Note**: You definitely want to run it several times to make sure you get a good average. First time is always slower. 
Throughput is the best metric here, since it's a single number and in this benchmark correlates very well with latency.
Performance takes a hit if you are constantly compiling, running, and shutting down. Best to compile, kill SBT, restart, 
then run. Very tedious, but the most accurate. Also when running on your mac be very aware of running other apps and it
is usually best to kill CPU heavy apps.
